Filter Design Assignment - EE 338 Digital Signal Processing

This assignment was about designing a bandstop and a bandpass filter using a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) as well as an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR). My filter number was 120, so m = 45 (refer Filt-design-2016.pdf for the detailed problem statement). The report (FDA_report_13D070043.pdf) contains the design procedure for designing an IIR filter based on the Butterworth and Chebyshev transfer functions and also the FIR filter for the same specifications. Finally, the MATLAB codes essentially draw the magnitude transfer function for all the four filters.
